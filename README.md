 An extenssive library of ready to go texture sets for all your modelling needs! Simply apply the desired nl2mat file to the material and you are good to go. 

## The goal
The main goal behind this is to create a universally useable material library for everyone to use in NoLimits2, as material edtiting, shader core language, normal maps and much more are often quite a daunting task for people. This way people can cut straight to designing and making rather than getting stuck on applying textures. Materials that are recolorable will have a few preset colour options to choose from, and more will be added as the collection grows. As well as some preset colours, they come with 4 entity slot options, allowing you to update the colour without even needing to open the nl2mat editor! 

## Why use these?
This set was a joint effort between people working on modelling and texturing, combining the most sought after materials with some extra materials to just add some final touches. It was made with optimisation and customisation in mind, meaning that you don't need to worry about performance impacts nearly as much when using this material set, and if you want a material in another colour you'll be sure to find it. Countless hours have been put into this pack to make sure that you can get the most out these and I am happy to expand the collection to cover even more textures!
